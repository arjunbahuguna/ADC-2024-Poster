#### Further Reading
* For a more detailed dive into AI plugins, I recommend Matthew Yee-King's book <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003365495/build-ai-enhanced-audio-plugins-matthew-john-yee-king">Build AI-enhanced Audio Plugins</a>.

* Early work by Alec Wright is a good introduction to neural audio effects (NAFx). His doctoral thesis, alongwith seven early papers on amplifier and effect emulation with deep learning, are available here: <a href="https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/items/f376f16e-982a-485e-8412-1cb8362f9908">Neural Modelling of Audio Effects</a>.

* Lecture by Christian Steinmetz from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) on Neural Audio Effects: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy6qNvV1RZY">YouTube</a>

* Steven Atkinson's Neural Amp Modeller is an open-source project that uses deep learning to create models of guitar amplifiers and pedals. <a href="https://www.neuralampmodeler.com">Link to Website</a>
